    Disconnect the mains cable before carrying out any work on the appliance. Make sure that the appliance is de-energised. This is the case when all LEDs on the front panel are off.

    **Possible product damage!**
    
    The surface can be damaged.
    Do not use scratching or abrasive objects or aggressive cleaning agents for cleaning.

    * Use a soft, lint-free, dry cleaning cloth to clean the housing.
    * Do not use chemicals, cleaning agents or solvents. This can lead to discolouration and corrosion of the outside of the appliance or result in an electric shock or fire.

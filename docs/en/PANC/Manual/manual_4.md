# 4 Setting it up

## 4.1 Installation

!!! info
    Always use all four screws to secure the PAN-C in the 19" rack.

!!! warning "Warning"
    **Risk of death or injury!**

    The mains cable fed through from the front must not be crushed. Ensure that the cable is routed freely in the 19" rack. There is a recess in the housing of the PAN-C for this purpose.


The PAN-C is designed in 19-inch/1U format and is intended for installation in a Coda Audio LINUS M-RACK, but can be installed in any standard 19" rack.

## 4.2 Power supply
!!! warning "Warning"
    **Danger of electric shock!**
    
    The appliance complies with appliance protection class I and may only be operated in supply networks with protective earth.
    The mains cable or the mains plug must not be damaged. If in doubt, replace it with a faultless mains cable.
    Disconnect the appliance from the mains during thunderstorms or during longer periods when the appliance is not in use.

!!! abstract "Attention!"
    **Risk of damage to the appliance!**

    Only connect the appliance to supply networks that correspond to the specified mains voltage range. This can be found on the information plate.

**Mains voltage range:**
230V~, 50Hz, 70mA.


The device connection is designed as a Neutrik powerCONÂ® TRUE1, which is a switchable connector. However, this should not be disconnected during audio playback as Coda Audio explicitly points this out. Always switch off the LINUS 12C first using the switch on the front panel or the shutdown function provided for this purpose in the Linus Control.


## 4.3 Connection
The PAN-C is intended to be mounted in the Coda M rack as a permanent replacement for the Coda PAN-M in combination with Linus 12C power amplifiers. For this purpose, all existing connections on the rear of the PAN-C can be wired according to the following diagram.
